    "\n",
    "1. Request the next member of the iterable.\n",
    "2. If the iterable is empty, exit the for-loop without running its body.\n",
    "3. If the iterable did produce a member, assign that member to **var** (if **var** was not previously defined, it becomes defined).\n",
    "4.  Execute the enclosed body of code.\n",
    "5. Go back to the first step \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically,  When the loop starts, the variable is assigned the first item (index 0) of the loop. The code is executed. The variable does not have to be used! When the block of code is executed, the variable gets assigned to the next item in the list. Block of code gets executed. Repeat again and again until the variable has been assigned to every item in the iterable."
